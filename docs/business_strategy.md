# Business Strategy: Safety-as-a-Service (SaaS)

## 1. The 100%+ Profit Model

We do not just sell drones; we sell **Guaranteed Safety**.

### Tiered Pricing

| Tier                        | Service                   | Pricing Model        | Margin                   |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------ | :------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **Tier 1: Hardware**        | Sell Drone Swarm          | One-time ₹15 Lakhs   | 25% (Hardware commodity) |
| **Tier 2: Inspection**      | "We fly it for you"       | ₹2 Lakhs per visit   | 40% (Labor intensive)    |
| **Tier 3: Sentinel (SaaS)** | **Autonomous 24/7 Watch** | **₹50 Lakhs / year** | **>150% (Zero labor)**   |

**Why Tier 3 Wins:**
Once installed, the drone swarm lives in a "Drone-in-a-Box" station. It wakes up, patrols, charges, and reports automatically.

- **Our Cost:** Electricity + Cloud Hosting (~₹20k/year).
- **Client Value:** Replaces manual inspection teams costing ₹1 Cr+.

### 2. The "Carbon Credit" Multiplier

- **The Hook:** Detect methane leaks manual crews miss.
- **The Profit:** certify "stopped leaks" as Carbon Credits.
- **Revenue Share:** We take **10-20%** of every carbon credit generated.

## Reliability Architecture: 6σ "Immortal" Swarm

## A. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)

Standard swarms crash if a leader fails. We use **PBFT Consenus**.

- **Mechanism:** Every navigation vector is voted on.
- **Threshold:** >66% agreement required to move.
- **Result:** System reliability jumps from 99% to **99.9999%** (survives 1/3rd fleet failure/hacking).

## B. Digital Twin "Pre-Flight" Oracle

Before physical liftoff, the mission is simulated **1,000 times** in NVIDIA Isaac Sim using real-time weather.

- **Inputs:** Real-time Wind, Temp, Pressure.
- **Action:** If >0.1% risk of collision, mission is auto-aborted or re-routed.
